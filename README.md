## Overview

This repository has the definitions and mappings for the **Horizon 2020 project ENGAGE**
to the GAINS model for air pollution analysis post-processing.

## Dependencies

This repository uses the Python package **nomenclature** for scenario validation and region processing.
The nomenclature package provides a structured way to define code-lists for validation and mappings
for automated region-processing to support model comparison projects.
[Read the nomenclature docs](https://nomenclature-iamc.readthedocs.io) for more information...

The nomenclature package depends on the Python package **pyam**.
The pyam package was developed to facilitate working with timeseries
data conforming to the IAMC structure. Features include scenario processing, plotting,
algebraic computations to derive indicators, validation of values, aggregation and downscaling of data,
and import/export with various file formats (`xlsx`, `csv`, frictionless-datapackage).
